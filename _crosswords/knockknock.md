Going back to basics today with a goofy little themed crossword for ya! Had a lot of fun constructing and cluing this one, and I hope you have fun solving it too!

Thanks again to [Adam Nicolle](https://luckyxwords.blogspot.com) for test solving, and I can't wait to see everyone (virtually) at my first [ACPT](https://www.acptonline.com) this weekend!<br/><br/>

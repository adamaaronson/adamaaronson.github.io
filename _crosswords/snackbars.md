Happy December! You might be thinking it's been a while since the last Aaronson.org crossword, and then you might be wondering, "what took Adam so long?" Well, I've been busy ...

- ... graduating from [college](https://aaronson.org/blog/whats-the-name-of-this-university)
- ... writing lots of [Wikipedia pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:BanjoZebra)
- ... traveling through [French-speaking Europe](https://www.instagram.com/p/CvqKfVXpyO3)
- ... moving to [New York City](https://x.com/aaaronson/status/1698839419418005812?s=20) and starting my [new job](https://twitter.com/aaaronson/status/1687877975226900480) and eating [a lot of bagels](https://x.com/aaaronson/status/1716941815218409724?s=20)
- ... going to Austin for a week and [meeting Adam Aaronson](https://x.com/aaaronson/status/1729591584306426076?s=20)

Now I'm back in New York, but it was in Austin that I somehow found the time to construct the entirety of this crossword. If you know me well enough, you'll be deeply unsurprised by its theme.

Thank you to my mom and my buddies Cale and Michael for test-solving this thing. Enjoy!<br/><br/>

New themeless alert! As a longtime fan of the brothers in question, the miracle of 38-Across and 7-Down crossing was too serendipitous _not_ to build a crossword around. So I went ahead and did that.

Thanks to [Ada Nicolle](https://luckyxwords.blogspot.com) and my mom for test solving! Enjoy the puzzle, and as always, don't forget to be awesome!

Bonjour-hi from Montr√©al! I made this entire puzzle aboard the 11-hour Amtrak ride here from New York City. There's something about Amtrak rides that get my crossword juices flowing. I guess they put me on the right train of thought.

You never know when the inspiration might strike for an Aaronson.org puzzle. Sometimes it will be while you're watching a really good movie (see 38-Across). And sometimes you'll publish it exactly 17 months after your last Aaronson.org puzzle, and that's okay!

Thanks to Alina Abidi, Paolo Pasco, and my mom for test solving, and to my friend Michael Garbus for the cluing angle at 61-Down.<br/><br/>

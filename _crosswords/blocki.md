Well, well, well, if it isn't a regular old puzzle with a totally inconspicuous grid design! Nothing to see here, folks!

Yeah okay, with another semester at Illinois freshly in the books, and with the Illini basketball season off to a *pretty* good start, now seemed like as good a time as any to make a shameless Fighting Illini tribute crossword. Once I realized 20- and 43-Across were both fifteen letters, the deal was already sealed. And it helps that our iconic Block I fits squarely into a crossword grid!

Enjoy the puzzle! Oh, and Merry Christmas Eve!

It's been a hot sec, but I've got a new themeless crossword for you! Here's what I've been up to:

- School! Back on campus for another semester, vibing and grinding and learning C.
- Making [Wordlisted](https://aaronson.org/wordlisted/)! It's a tool for puzzle makers and anyone else who likes words. It's been so awesome getting your feedback and hearing all the ways Wordlisted has come in handy!
- Jazz! As a jazz trombonist, I'm a big fan. And hey, I made this puzzle out of it!

It's themeless puzzle #2! This puzzle was based on my incessant urge to seed a grid with 32-Across. I'm finding that making crosswords specifically for a non-mainstream publication is massively freeing, since it allows me to play around with entries I might hesitate to include in a newspaper submission.

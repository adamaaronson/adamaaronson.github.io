Happy Pi Day to all who observe, and happy regular ol' Monday to everyone else! Pay no attention to the gap since my last puzzle here; time is a flat circle. It's been a busy (and fun!) semester, but it's my spring break now, so I suddenly have ample time for puzzles!

I have a USDA-certified Tricky puzzle for you today, with a theme that's sure to make you say, "yup, that's an Adam puzzle alright."

Thanks to [Chris](http://arctanxwords.blogspot.com), [Paolo](http://gridsthesedays.blogspot.com), and my mom and dad for test solving, and enjoy!<br/><br/>

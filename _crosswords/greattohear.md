Well whaddya know, another themeless puzzle! Not too much to say about this one, except for that it was very much inspired by the fifteen-letterness of 38-Across. Also, I can't believe the clue for 30-Down actually works. But you won't know why until you solve it!

Hope you enjoy the puzzle, and use this as solving music:<br/>

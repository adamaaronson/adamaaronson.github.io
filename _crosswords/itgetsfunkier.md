I guess I lied about my puzzle output slowing down last week, since I have a brand spankin' new themeless for you today!

This crossword was unabashedly seeded with the great 6-Across, which just so happens to be my personal all-time most listened-to artist on Spotify. What a coincidence! And hey, even if you're not among the 6-Across 60-Across, there should be plenty of funky fresh entries to go around.

Enjoy the puzzle! And listen to this, and then once you're done, listen to 6-Across's entire discography.<br/>

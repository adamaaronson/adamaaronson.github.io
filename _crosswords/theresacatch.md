Back at ya with another themed crossword! Much has happened since my last puzzle here, including the ol' [puzgate](https://9to5mac.com/2021/08/02/new-york-times-crosswords-third-party-app/) (about which my thoughts are: alright, cool, sounds good), the ol' [breakthrough covid case](https://twitter.com/aaaronson/status/1422621999818498053), and a couple of [NYT puzzles](https://aaronson.org/publications/) by yours truly! 

This should be a fun one. Big thanks to [Quiara Vasquez](https://qvxwordz.blogspot.com) and my mom for test solving, and big thanks to you for solving right now!<br/><br/>

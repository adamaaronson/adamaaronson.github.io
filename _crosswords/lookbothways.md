Happy 2023! The title says this is a themeless puzzle, which is slightly misleading, but I don't make the rules. Actually I totally do make the rules, since this is my website. Themeless it is!

Since my last puzzle here, I've been busy making stuff like [Full Moon Albums](https://aaronson.org/blog/full-moon-albums) and [New Year Zone](https://aaronson.org/blog/new-year-zone) and a bunch of [Wikipedia pages](https://twitter.com/aaaronson/status/1607803753687838721?s=20&t=eepxLpS3B6oST8FC1Fuxmw). I also had a guest freestyle (huh, maybe that's a better name than themeless) [puzzle](https://club72.wordpress.com/2022/12/28/guest-freestyle-4-adam-aaronson/) over on Tim Croce's blog Club 72. Oh, and I also had a [puzzle](https://www.nytimes.com/crosswords/game/daily/2023/01/07) last week in some newspaper from New York. Check these things out if you haven't!

But first, enjoy this crossword! And don't forget to look both ways!<br/><br/>

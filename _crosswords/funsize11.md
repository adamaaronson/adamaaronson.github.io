This one goes out to my friend Sacha, who I interned with at Duolingo this summer. He challenged me to make him a crossword so easy that he could solve it. Mind you, English isn't Sacha's first language. Or second. Or third. It's his fourth, after French, German, and Luxembourgish.

So, hope you enjoyâ€”and Sacha, hope you can solve this!<br/><br/>

That's right, this series got picked up after its pilot. Think of this puzzle as a tribute to maybe my favorite piece of 3-letter crossword fill in existence.

Funny thing about this grid: once I filled in about half of it, the other half of the fill was entirely locked into place. Grids with lots of interlocking long entries like this can be very high-risk, high-reward to construct. But luckily this fill was pretty good, so it paid off!

Oh also, this site just passed its first anniversary of existence! Crazy to think I've already posted 30 puzzles here. Thank you all for your love and support over the past year!

Enjoy the puzzle! And I promise you won't _really_ need any Steely Dan knowledge to solve it. ðŸ˜‰<br/><br/>

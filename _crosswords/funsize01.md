This is the first of what I'm calling Fun Size crosswords! These will be easy, medium-sized puzzles, think 7&times;7 to 12&times;12 or so, often with some sort of mini-theme or other fun element. Fun Size #1 was inspired by my realization that 8-Across and 10-Across stack particularly well on top of each other. Enjoy! <br/><br/>

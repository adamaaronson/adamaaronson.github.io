Wide puzzle! It might not be immediately apparent why, but this puzzle's seed necessitated a long boi grid. That's 13% more crossword than usual, so you better be thankful.

I head back to Champaign tomorrow! So as the school year picks up, expect either a slight slowdown in posts here or, like last year, no change at all somehow. Who's to say!

Thanks to [Paolo](http://gridsthesedays.blogspot.com) for test solving. Hope you all enjoy!<br/><br/>

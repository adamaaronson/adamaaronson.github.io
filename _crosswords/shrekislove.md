Look, a crossword! And it lacks a theme. Where I come from we call that a themeless.

This is the first triple-15-stack puzzle I've posted, and I'm real happy with how it turned out! I've been wanting to put one of these 15s in a puzzle for ages, plus I think it's pretty neat that every word crossing the stack is five or more letters.

Also, as announced yesterday, I was invited to make a puzzle for the [Boswords](https://www.boswords.org) Spring Themeless League! I'm honored to be making my tournament crossword construction debut, especially on such a killer team of constructors.

Thanks to [Ada](https://luckyxwords.blogspot.com) (who's also on that killer team!) and [Chris](http://arctanxwords.blogspot.com) for test solving. Enjoy!<br/><br/>

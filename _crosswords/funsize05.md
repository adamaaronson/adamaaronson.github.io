It's the fifth Fun Size puzzle! See how quickly you can solve it, or don't, because time is meaningless!

Now that I'm back at school, you can probably expect a slight slowdown of puzzles here, as I try to juggle crosswords with classes with social life. Luckily, being on a college campus has got me noticing all sorts of interesting vocabulary, wordplay, and 15-letter phrases, so I've had no shortage of random crossword ideas storming my brain. Enjoy!<br/><br/>

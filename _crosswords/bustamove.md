What's puzzlin', puzzlers? It's ya boy Adam, back again with another themeless crossword!

Still workshopping that intro, but I'm excited about this puzzle! I've been really into 14-letter entries lately. They may seem like the runts of the wordlist litter, but their length combined with their untapped potential can make them feel super fresh in a grid. So this grid's got four of themâ€”including 4-Down, one of my all-time favorite terms.

With that, make sure to like, comment, subscribe, and enjoy the solve!

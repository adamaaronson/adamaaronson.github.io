I was lucky enough to have my whole gang here this weekend, test-solving this exact puzzle around a Father's Day campfire! My dad certainly inspired the answer to 25-Down, a phrase I probably hear around the house more than your average Joe.

Anyways, take this puzzle as less of a political statement and more of an endorsement of a singularly superb slogan. Enjoy! <br/><br/>

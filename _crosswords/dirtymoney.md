Right on schedule! I have a crossword for your solving pleasure. This one is silly, goofy, and probably wouldn't fly in a newspaper for reasons you'll soon find out.

In other news, I have a blog now! You might be thinking, wait, isn't this already a blog? And then I might be responding, yes, but this new blog is for regular words, not crosswords! My first post was a gratuitously deep dive into the game [Twenty Questions](https://aaronson.org/blog/twenty-questions). Go give it a read if you haven't!

But first, enjoy this puzzle. And afterwards, have a happy Thanksgiving!<br/><br/>

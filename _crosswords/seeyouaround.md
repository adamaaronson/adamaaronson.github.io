Rabbit rabbit rabbit! It's another themeless, and it's 16x15, because reasons. I'm back at school for my last semester (ðŸ˜³), which means I have time to work on crosswords in between my jazz band and vegetable gardening classes.

Three facts about this puzzle:

1. A lot of people ask me where my starting point is when I make a crossword. For this one, I think you might just be able to figure that out.
2. It was test-solved by my friends at school and my mom (not at school). Thanks, friends and mom!
3. 45-Down still makes me giggle to this day.

With that, stay in school, don't do drugs, and enjoy the puzzle!<br/><br/>

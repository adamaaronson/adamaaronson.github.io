It is once again collab o'clock! You may know Parker as the co-host of [Cursewords Live](https://www.twitch.tv/cursewordslive), the daddy of [various](https://twitter.com/pomological) [excellent](https://twitter.com/78_sampler) [Twitter](https://twitter.com/choochoobot) [bots](https://twitter.com/oldroadside), or the guy who somehow has the Twitter handle [@xor](https://twitter.com/xor).

This puzzle arose from a certain realization in a certain Discord conversation about a certain banger tweet of Parker's ([spoilers within](https://twitter.com/xor/status/1331726108039942147)). Parker was like "damn we should collab," and I was like, "yes." So we made this puzzle together! And it's 18x17, because why not?

Quoth Parker: *Thank you to Adam for this hilarious idea and such excellent construction work. It's a shame to know that I'll never do anything as good as the tweet in question.*

Thanks to my mom and [Brooke Husic](https://xwordsbyaladee.blogspot.com) for test solvingâ€”enjoy!<br/><br/>

When the world needed him most, he posted another crossword! It has once again been a hot sec since my last puzzle here, but I've been a busy boy.

I just wrapped up my third year (!!!) at UIUC, where my mind was constantly jumping back and forth between neural networks, syntax trees, and jazz composition. And crosswords, of courseâ€”if you missed it, I recently unveiled [Swordsmith](https://github.com/adamaaronson/swordsmith), an exploration of crossword filling algorithms I've been working on over the past school year. I managed to get class credit for it this semester, so I technically took a class about crosswords. Watch out Will Shortz, I'm coming for that enigmatology degree!

Thank you to [Chris](http://arctanxwords.blogspot.com) for test solving, and I hope you all enjoy this themeless!<br/><br/>

I've got another themed crossword for ya today! The topic of this puzzle is something I'm admittedly obsessed with, and something I can't recommend enough to any human living in the present day.

This grid just so happens to somehow be my first foray into leftâ€“right symmetry, as well as my first time flouting that pesky "grids must be fully connected" convention. But for good reason! Can you, almighty solver, figure out what that reason is?

Big thanks to my Canadian counterpart [Adam Nicolle](https://luckyxwords.blogspot.com) for test-solving this puzzle! Hope you all enjoy it, and please feast your ears on this aptly-titled banger:<br/><br/>

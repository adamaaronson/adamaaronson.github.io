And just like that, I'm back with another brand new themeless crossword! This puzzle's grid may or may not be breaking new grounds. Three long entries stacked diagonally on top of each other is a common grid design often called a "stagger stack", but in my experience I've never seen a themeless with *double* full-sized stagger stacks. I'm super curious if any crosswords have used this type of grid beforeâ€”please enlighten me if you know of any!

Incidentally, I'm not the only one to have recently explored double stagger stacks like this! My good buds [Sid Sivakumar](https://www.sidsgrids.com/post/puzzle-50-themeless) and [Ricky Cruz](https://cruzzles.blogspot.com/2020/12/puzzle-34-limited-edition-themeless.html) had some dank double-stagger-stack action afoot in their latest themelesses, both of which I wholeheartedly endorse.

With that, enjoy the crossword! Oh and shoutout to my roommate, 5-Across.

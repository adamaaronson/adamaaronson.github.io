Howdy, puzzlin' partners! I may be in the thick of studying for finals, but that doesn't mean I don't have some crossword time to spare!

Today's puzzle is a themeless collab with the illustrious Skateboard P, sometimes known as Paolo Pasco! As always, Paolo has been putting out banger after banger over on his site [Grids These Days](http://gridsthesedays.blogspot.com), which you already follow if you don't live under a rock. Making stuff with him is always a blast, oh and it's his frickin birthday today! ðŸŽ‰

Paolo says: *it's always a great time working with adam! his cluing voice is incredible, and our puzzle sensibilities really vibe. this site's been all bangers, and i'm honored to be a part of it. now if you'll excuse me i'm gonna try to break this post &lt;br/>&lt;div>&lt;span*

Give it a shot, and enjoy!<br/><br/>

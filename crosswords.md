I've been making crossword puzzles since 2019. My puzzles have been published in outlets like _The New York Times_, _The New Yorker_, and _The Wall Street Journal_, and I make music-themed puzzles every other weekday for [_Billboard_](https://www.billboard.com/author/adam-aaronson/). For a full list of the crosswords I've had published in newspapers and other outlets, check out my [publications](/publications).

But sometimes, I have ideas for crosswords that can only reasonably be published on my own website, for one reason or another. For those, look no further!

## Hey there!

I'm Adam Aaronson, and I like making things, especially software, music, and puzzles.

Born and raised in Chicagoland, I'm a Computer Science major and Linguistics minor at the University of Illinois at Urbanaâ€“Champaign. 

I also play trombone and electric bass, and right now I'm probably listening to jazz, funk, podcasts, or R&B, and drinking coffee, tea, or good old-fashioned water.

While you're here, please check out some of my [projects](/projects) and try to solve a [crossword](/crosswords) or three!

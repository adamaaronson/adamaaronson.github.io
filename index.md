## Hey there!

I'm Adam Aaronson, and I like making things, especially software, music, and puzzles.

Born and raised in Chicagoland, I'm now living in New York City working as a software engineer at [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com). I graduated from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in 2023 with a Computer Science major and Linguistics minor, and I also interned as a software engineer at [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com).

I also play trombone and electric bass, and right now I'm probably listening to [music](https://aaronson.org/full-moon-albums/) or [podcasts](/podcasts), writing about stuff I like on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:BanjoZebra), and drinking coffee, tea, or good old-fashioned water.

While you're here, you might as well check out some of my [projects](/projects) and try to solve a [crossword](/crosswords) or three!

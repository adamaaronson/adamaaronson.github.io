## Hey there!

I'm Adam Aaronson, and I like making things, especially software, music, and puzzles.

Born and raised in Chicagoland, I'm a Computer Science major and Linguistics minor at the University of Illinois Urbanaâ€“Champaign. 

I also play trombone and electric bass, and right now I'm probably [listening](https://aaronson.org/full-moon-albums/) to jazz, funk, podcasts, or hip hop, and drinking coffee, tea, or good old-fashioned water.

While you're here, you might as well check out some of my [projects](/projects) and try to solve a [crossword](/crosswords) or three!

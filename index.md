## Hey there!

I'm Adam Aaronson, and I like making things, especially software, music, and puzzles.

Born and raised in Chicagoland, I'm now living in New York City working as a software engineer at [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com). I graduated from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in 2023 with a Computer Science major and a Linguistics minor.

I also play jazz trombone, electric bass, and ukulele, listen to a lot of [music](https://aaronson.org/full-moon-albums/), write [blog](/blog) posts and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:BanjoZebra) articles, and eat and drink anything that tastes good.

While you're here, you might as well check out some of my [projects](/projects) and try to solve a [crossword](/crosswords) or three!

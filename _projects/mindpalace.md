Mind Palace is an incremental game whose fundamental unit of interaction is answering flashcard-style trivia questions. If you get the question wrong, you learn something and you earn a nugget. But if you know the answer, your fount of knowledge starts to produce one nugget per second. Soon, you'll be able to spend your nuggets on blocks to build your mind palace. I built the first working demo of the game at WikiGameJam 2025 using TypeScript and React, and have been developing it since. It's still a work in progress, but you can try it here!

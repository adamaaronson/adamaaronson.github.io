Mind Palace is an incremental game whose fundamental unit of interaction is answering flashcard-style trivia questions. If you get the question wrong, you learn something and you earn a _nugget_. But if you know the answer, your _fount of knowledge_ starts to produce one nugget per second. Soon, you'll be able to spend your nuggets on blocks to build your _mind palace_. I built the first working demo of the game at WikiGameJam 2025 using TypeScript and React, and have been developing it since. It's still a work in progress, but you can play it here!

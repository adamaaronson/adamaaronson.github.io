An eerily realistic single-player air hockey simulator in your browser! The game runs entirely in an HTML5 canvas with pure JavaScript. It was my first foray into creating an intelligent "computer player" that acts similarly to a real human. While it may not pass the air hockey Turing test, it feels pretty natural and it's certainly fun to play against. Try it out online for free!

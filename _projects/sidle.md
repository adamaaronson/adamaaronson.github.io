Sidle is a side-scrolling puzzle platformer game that takes place inside of a Wordle emoji grid. I had the idea for this while half-asleep in 2023, worked on it on and off for a year, and finished it in 2024. I built the game in TypeScript and React, and you can play it on any device with a web browser. The game has 10 levels, each one slightly trickier than the last. Go forth and conquer!

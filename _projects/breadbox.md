Is it bigger than a breadbox? Breadbox is an online realtime multiplayer Twenty Questions game I created with my roommate Cale Wolf. We built the game's frontend using React and SCSS, and we made the backend realtime database using Firebase. We created Breadbox over the span of one weekend for HackIllinois 2021, where it placed 2nd overall!

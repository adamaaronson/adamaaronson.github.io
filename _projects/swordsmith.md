An open-source sandbox for crossword filling algorithms. Swordsmith is the result of over a year of research and exploration in crossword filling, which turned out to be a rabbit hole of constraint programming, heuristics, and backtracking algorithms. I created it in Python with the help of some of my friends at school, and now it's in the hands of the greater crossword community. Check it out on GitHub, and forge yourself some grids!

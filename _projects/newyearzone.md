Why celebrate the New Year just once when you can celebrate it 38 times? New Year Zone is a site I made with my dad that counts down to the New Year in every time zone, so you can share the fun with the whole world! I developed the site in TypeScript and React, with SCSS for styling and Framer Motion for animation. The project is built with Vite and hosted with Cloudflare Pages. Join the celebration, and get in the zoneâ€”the New Year Zone!

A classic platformer game I built in C++ and openFrameworks. It follows an estranged penguin's journey to escape the desert. With 10 levels of increasing difficulty, a physics system built from scratch, and fully original sprites and animations, Penguin Time was an absolute blast to create. The game requires openFrameworks to download and play, but its code is open source on GitHub.

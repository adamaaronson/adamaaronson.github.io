A souped-up snake web game I developed entirely in HTML, CSS, and pure JavaScript. It tracks the user's high score and stats, features a shop where the user can spend the fruits they've accumulated, and offers three speed levels for the user to unlock. The logo and sprites are all original artwork. Snaclops is dangerously addictive and free to play online!

A Twitter bot that tweets a randomly generated fake Pokémon, or Fakemon, every day! And when I say random, I mean random—even their names are randomly generated using a Markov chain modeled after all 898 existing Pokémon names. I made the bot in Python using the Tweepy wrapper for the Twitter API, and it's running in the cloud using Heroku.

I listen to a lot of music. Since 2020, I've been logging every album I've listened to and rating each one with a moon emoji. Full Moon Albums documents the albums that are out of this world. I made the site in TypeScript with React and SCSS, along with some Python preprocessing that uses the Spotify API to fetch the cover art and Spotify link for each album. I used Framer Motion for animations, and I built the project with Vite. Explore the list, and discover some bangers!

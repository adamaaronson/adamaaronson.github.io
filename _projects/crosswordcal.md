The Crossword Calendar is a wall calendar where each month's grid doubles as the grid of an American-style crossword, with one letter to fill into each day's square. I conjured up the idea for the calendar in March 2024, and spent the rest of the year constructing crossword grids for every month of 2025, writing the clues, designing the calendar layouts, and building a Shopify store configured with the print-on-demand service Printify so that people could order the calendars for themselves in time for the holidays. My blog post traces the Crossword Calendar's winding path from a half-waking idea to my first ever physical product!

The Crossword Calendar is a wall calendar where each month's grid doubles as the grid of an American-style crossword, with one letter to fill into each day's square. I conjured up the idea for the calendar in March 2024, and over the next eight months I constructed crossword grids for every month of 2025, wrote the clues, designed the calendar layouts, built a Shopify store integrated with the print-on-demand service Printify, and wrote a blog post about the journey.

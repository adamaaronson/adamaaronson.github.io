Etheremin is a new musical instrument that assumes the shape and size of your browser window. Named after the theremin and based on its dual controls of pitch and volume, I created Etheremin as a Secret Santa gift for Guy Dupont, inspired by his experimentations with bizarre audio inputs and outputs. I developed it using TypeScript, React, and Tailwind, using JavaScript's stock AudioContext API for audio processing. Make some music with it on your computer or phone!

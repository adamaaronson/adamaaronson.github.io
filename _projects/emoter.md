It came to my attention that there was no good website for generating Slack and Discord emoji that are just text on a colored background (to say things like "yay!" or "nice work!"), so I cooked one up myself. I built Emoter in a single evening as a fork of Whisperer, similarly using React, TypeScript, and the html2canvas library. Tell your favorite Slack or Discord server about it!
